Assistants
                </h1>
                <p class="form-content">A property management virtual assistant service is an outsourced part of your team.
                    They are dedicated virtual assistants working from the 'other side of the world' office.
                    They can operate during regular business hours or outside. A property management
                    virtual assistant is a safe and hardworking employee who helps your PM team run
                    more smoothly.
                    And, best of all, a Property Management Virtual Assistant costs a quarter to a third
                    of what a full-time employee would.

                Assistants Services</h2>
            <p class="text-center vs-content">Virtual assistants are familiar with the pressures of everyday work and the
                complexities of the real estate industry. They may help with various management
                issues, such as valuation, chartered surveyors, and building surveying. They feel
                comfortable and confident when using online Property Management Software. They
                are knowledgeable about Real Estate/Property Management processes and are
                well-versed in various Real Estate/Property Management terms.
                </p>

      <p class="vs-content">When it comes to property management, it's all about the flow. It starts with
        onboarding new landlords, then continues advertising, prospecting tenants, leasing
        properties, conducting inspections, dealing with repairs, and finally, lease renewals,
        vacating, and relisting. The PM process is essential, but it takes time and requires a
        lot of checking boxes.
        </p>

        <p class="vs-content">A virtual assistant for property management may assist with every process stage.
            Your dedicated team member will significantly reduce the amount of time and
            paperwork that is now slowing down your procedures. But what are the various
            things your Property Management Virtual Assistant can do for you? Below listed are
            the roles your Virtual Assistant can help you in:</p>

            <h3 class="fs-2 fw-bold text-center">How Virtual Assistant can help you?
            </h3>
            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-5">1. Virtual Assistant can help you</h5>
            <p class="vs-content">Onboarding new landlords and properties are the initial stage in the property
                management process. Once you've found a new customer, your PMVA may
                take over and make sure all of the paperwork is in order.
                In a perfect world, a new landlord would deliver all of the documentation at
                once, but in reality, you'll frequently be hunting down insurance, smoke alarm
                information, and bank account information. You may delegate those
                back-and-forth conversations to your offshore team.
                </p>
                <p class="vs-content">The client will be onboarded into your systems, including your trust account
                    software, by a PMVA.</p>
                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">2. Advertising</h5>
                <p class="vs-content">You may begin advertising the property as soon as your new customer is
                    completely set up. Of course, images and property descriptions will be
                    handled by your knowledgeable local property management team. Your VA, on
                    the other hand, will be responsible for taking that information and uploading it
                    to each ad site you utilise.
                    It may be Zilio, Trademe, Realestate.com.au, Domain, or a slew of others,
                    depending on where you live. They will also create social media postings for
                    Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Whatsapp.</p>
                   
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">3. Enquiries</h5>
                    <p class="vs-content">There will undoubtedly be an increase in inquiries once your successful
                        advertising effort is in place. The majority of these are simple and do not
                        necessitate the time of your local personnel. Allow your property management
                        virtual assistant to handle emails, answer property inquiries, and provide
                        advice on viewings.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">4. Application:</h5>
                        <p  class="vs-content">You should have a few good candidates who have filed applications by now.
                            Your PMVA will review the application and double-check that all of the
                            information is correct. If it isn't, they may contact the candidates right away
                            through SMS or email to fill up any gaps. Then it's only a matter of verifying
                            rental, professional, and job references — easy in principle, but
                            time-consuming in practice!
                            </p>
                            <p class="vs-content1">All of these tests are necessary, but they take a lot of time. While your
                                property managers are prospecting other landlords and homes, this fussy
                                information may be obtained using a PMVA.
                                Your PM sends the applications to the landlord for approval after all of the
                                information and references are ready.
                                </p>

                            <h5  class="fw-bold mt-3">5. Applications</h5>

                                <p class="vs-content1">If you've read thus far, you've probably observed that employing a PMVA is
                                    contingent on you having procedures and processes in place. If your company is like
                                    an octopus, with multiple tentacles that don't communicate with one another, hiring
                                    offshore personnel will be a challenge. We don't want anyone to believe that
                                    employing an offshore workforce would solve all of their problems. If you truly want
                                    to make your business successful, you must be ready to devote some time to its
                                    management. What it can do, though, is free up your local staff's important time.</p>

                                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">6. Social Media Management</h5>
                                <p class="vs-content">
                                    Nobody doubts social media is one of the most crucial marketing tools for any business. It is
                                    a great way to promote and market properties as people use social media daily, making it
                                    very obvious for posts to get traction in no time. Our Virtual assistant will handle your social
                                    media account to grow your online fame.
                                </p>

                                <h5  class="fw-bold mt-3">7. Data entry for Real Estate
                                </h5>
                                <p class="vs-content">Data entry often includes writing skills, which aid in managing personal and professional
                                    information. Our virtual assistant for real estate will handle all of your data entry
                                    requirements with ease.</p>

                                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">8. Skip Tracing
                                    </h5>
                                    <p class="vs-content">People can skip their daily responsibilities, but effective skip tracing can give away their
                                        location as they are always connected online, and it’s not possible for one to not leave any
                                        trace. Therefore, skip tracing is vital to let you know where you can find the person you’re
                                        trying to locate, which our Virtual assistant can do for your business</p>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">9. Admin Task</h5>
                        <p class="vs-content">Administration in the organisation is very essential, especially for a real estate business.
                            Online web pages and social media account management are insignificant. Administration
                            can be assured by our Virtual assistant resulting in proper functioning.</p>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">10. Lead Generation and Appointment Scheduling</h5>
                        <p class="vs-content">Lead generation is vital for finding people who are committed to your company. As a real
                            estate agent, you require clients to trust you with their information. Our virtual real estate
                            assistant can help you generate leads and set up appointments.</p>
