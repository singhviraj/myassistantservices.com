            <h3 class="fs-2 fw-bold text-center">Important Of Bookkeeping?
            </h3>
            <p class="vs-content">Bookkeeping is the very backbone of accounting. Without a proper bookkeeping system, the financial system could collapse, and hence the company could face serious issues. Small businesses often ignore this critical task of recording every penny spent as a trivial matter. </p>
           <h5 class="fw-bold fs-4">Bookkeeping is essential in several ways :</h5>
            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-5">1.	Records the transactions</h5>
            <p class="vs-content">It systematically records, updates, and maintains a company's financial transactions for future reference.
                </p>
                
                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">2. Gives A  Clear Image</h5>
                <p class="vs-content">When a record of transactions is adequately maintained, it gives the company a clear idea of where its company stands and what its future will look like. It provides detailed information about the profits and losses the company has sustained. </p>
                   
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">3. Helps in formulating policies related to finance </h5>
                    <p class="vs-content">Since a proper record of the transactions is made, it can help the company develop new policy decisions in the future.
                        </p>
                       

                        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">4. Detects fraud and errors:</h5>
                        <p  class="vs-content">The bookkeeping system is designed to record and update every little detail regularly, leaving no room for fraudulent businesses.
                            </p>

            <h4 class="fs-2 fw-bold text-center">Financial Reporting & Statements
            </h4>
          <p class="vs-content"> <span class="fw-bold text-dark">Another essential aspect of bookkeeping financial statements is a collection of summary reports of a company's financial state and transactions. It shows the summary of complete transactions made by the company, its profits or losses, loans taken and paid, and more. Bookkeeping plays a significant role in generating financial statements. </p>
            <p class="vs-content1 fw-bold">Financial Statements are essential as they play a significant role in many services, some of which include:</p>
        <p>1. Determine the ability of a business to generate cash.</p>
        <p>2. Determine the capability of a company to pay back debts.</p>
        <p>3. Indicate the financial condition of a business.</p>
        <p>4. To use annual reports distributed to their investors as a reference.</p>

        <p class="vs-content1">-  Financial statements determine a company's future and show its credibility as a successful business. Financial information tells the tale of the years of trust put in a trade by investors. A flaw in this can reduce their value as a good business and break the years of faith built by a company.</p>
           <p class="vs-content1">- Many small companies or startups don't hire individual professionals as it can be expensive and instead entrust it to agencies that provide bookkeeping and financial services.</p>
           <p class="vs-content1">- One such agency is My Assistant Services, which has proved its credibility with exceptional digital assistant services in bookkeeping, financial statements, virtual assistance and many more.</p>
