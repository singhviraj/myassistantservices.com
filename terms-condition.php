Once you have submitted an online order form giving details of your enquiry, you will be contacted by My Assistant Services to request any additional information, and to provide a cost estimate and/or to confirm that the service can be carried out according to your specifications. Once we agree on the scope of the project/task, the timelines and the fees, we will assign an assistant/team to this engagement, subject to these terms and conditions.</p>
            
            <p><b>Obligations:</b></p>

You will provide regular and timely feedback and review through the entire term of the project. If such communication is not timely or forthcoming, within the period agreed to between the Parties, due to which the project extends beyond the term of the agreement, then My Assistant Services will charge you for the additional hours as per the agreed rate. My Assistant Services will not be liable to bear any loss or pay any compensation for such delays.</p><br>
            <p>For accounts on Monthly Recurring basis the number of hours are to be consumed within one billing cycle and are not roll-over hours unless agreed upon at the time of sale between the sales agent and the customer.</p>

You will bear an annual interest rate of 25.99%, and a daily periodic rate of 0.0712% for any unpaid amount after the credit period of 7 days, which will start to accrue immediately thereafter.</p>
