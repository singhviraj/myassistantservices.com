           <b><p>Information You Provide to Us</h6></b>
           <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000">When you use the Service, you may provide us with information about you. This may include your name and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained through the My Assistant Services platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms.

You may also provide us with information about your contacts or friends if, for example, you’d like to add those contacts to a message room. Agencies may also provide us with information about VAs associated with the Agency. </p>
           <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"><b>Personal Information:</b> In the course of using the Service (whether as a Client or VA or Agency), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number </p>
            <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"><b>Payment Information:</b> If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing address </p>
            <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"><b>Identity Verification:</b> We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings.

            <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000">Like other online companies, we receive technical information when you use our Services. We use these technologies to analyze how people use the Service, to improve how our Site functions, to save your log-in information for future sessions, and to serve you with advertisements that may interest you. </p>
            <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"> We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service. This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, which links you clicked on, which pages or content you viewed and for how long, other similar information and statistics about your interactions, such as content response times, download errors and length of visits to certain pages and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.</p>
             <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000">The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other unique device identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.

              <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"> 1. CONTACTING US </p>
               <p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"> If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through the Data Request Form available in our website or email us at info@myassistantservices.com You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
<p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"> Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service. </p>
<p class="mt-3" style= "color: #000000"> The ACC sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the ACC and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. </p>
