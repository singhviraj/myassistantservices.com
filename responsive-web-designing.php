                       <p class="vs-content" style="font-weight:500;"><span class="fw-bold">Responsive Web design</span>  is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
  
            The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.
                </p>
                
                <p class="vs-content" style="font-weight:500;"> One may also have to consider the settings on their devices; if they have a VPN for iOS on their iPad, for example, the website should not block the user’s access to the page. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.</p>

                </p>
            
                <p class="vs-content">Client Experience– Hiring virtual legal assistants provides clients with an excellent customer experience. Assistants aid attorneys and law firms in fulfilling all of their obligations to clients. Virtual legal assistants are always one step ahead of the competition in every element of their work, from client conversations to administrative chores.</p>

However, deciding which activities to efficiently outsource to a legal VA is highly dependent on the specific circumstances and demands of the law business.</p>
